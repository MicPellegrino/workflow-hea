#1 Compression Phase:

Water molecules are compressed along the z-axis to achieve a target density while graphene is frozen in place.
Temperature is controlled using a Langevin thermostat.


2# Thermalization and Relaxation Phase:

Constraints on graphene are removed, and the system is relaxed using energy minimization.
The system transitions to an anisotropic pressure-controlled ensemble, with separate temperature controls for water and graphene.
